# Griptape and ShotGrid: A Practical Approach to Tool Integration
![ShotGrid Assets view](assets/img/shotgrid_assets.png)

## Course Description
This course offers a friendly and accessible path to understand how Griptape Tools, functioning as specialized Python classes, enable Language Learning Models (LLMs) to interface with external APIs and datasets, thus broadening their operational scope.

Throughout the course, you'll gain practical insights into constructing custom tools for specific activities. Our sessions will revolve around creating a [Autodesk ShotGrid](https://www.shotgridsoftware.com/) client tool as a practical example. Imagine commanding the chatbot to "Create 20 assets for a 1950's kitchen counter and give them relevant descriptions." This scenario encapsulates the kind of interactive and practical tasks you will be able to accomplish. By guiding you through the construction of such tools, the course not only makes learning interactive but also showcases the real-world applicability of your skills in tool creation.

## What is ShotGrid?
ShotGrid is Autodesk's production management software. It is used mainly to manage Media and Entertainment (Games, Film, Commercials, etc) productions. You can track deadlines, manage budgets, create and manage asset development, collaborate with others, and more. 

It's got a rich Python API, which many studios have used to integrate it with various software tools like [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/za/products/maya/overview-dts), [SideFX Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/), [Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/nuke), and many others.
