# Stage 14: Making it Quick

This is it, you're ready to ride! Let's add a final touch to our chat application to make it a little more user-friendly and visually appealing. We'll be utilizing the `Console` class from the `rich` library and its `spinner` functionality. This will provide a visual cue to the user that the agent is processing their input.

**Note:** There are lots of spinners available. You can check them out by running `python -m rich.spinner` in your terminal.

## Step 14.1: Importing the Console

```python
from rich.console import Console
```

Importing the Console class from the `rich` library is simple and straightforward, and should be familliar to you by this point in the lesson.

## Step 14.2: Modifying the Respond Method

We will add a spinner to our `respond` method in the `MyAgent` subclass. This will show an animated spinner in the console while our agent is processing the user's input. This makes the app feel more responsive.

Update the `respond` method as follows:

```python
class MyAgent(Agent):
    def respond(self, user_input):
        console = Console()
        with console.status(spinner="simpleDotsScrolling", status=""):
            agent_response = self.run(user_input)
        
```

In the code above, `console.status(spinner="simpleDotsScrolling", status="")` starts an animated spinner in the console that will run until the block of code it is wrapping (the agent's processing of user input) completes. Note, we've left `status` blank - because we don't really need to send any text. However, feel free to add some text here if you desire.

Now when you run the chat, you'll notice the animated spinner right after you ask the chatbot a question!
