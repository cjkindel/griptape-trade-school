!!! question "Why Grind?"

    **Grinding**, in the world of skateboarding, refers to sliding along an edge (like a rail or curb) using the trucks of the skateboard. It's a step up from basic tricks, requiring a combination of balance, speed, and precisionâ€”mirroring our Intermediate level where you'll apply and integrate core concepts of Griptape into more complex projects.
