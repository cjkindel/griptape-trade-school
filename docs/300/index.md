!!! question "Why Ollie?"

    The ollie is a fundamental skateboarding trick that involves leaping into the air without the use of the rider's hands, but rather by exerting pressure on the tail of the board while jumping. Named after its inventor, Alan "Ollie" Gelfand, the trick requires skill and practice, much like our Advanced courses, where you delve deeper into the intricate workings and technical details of Griptape.
