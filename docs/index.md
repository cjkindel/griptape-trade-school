# Why Trade School?
<div class="grid cards-flat" markdown>

-   ## Projects
    ---
  
    We believe that the best learning experience is by creating with a clear goal. All our courses are **project-based**, meaning you're applying concepts in real-world scenarios, enhancing your understanding. 
    
    Also, they're just way more fun.

-   ## Code Snippets

    ---
  
    How can you learn coding without helpfuls snippets? We use actual code, with actual line numbers, highliting changes as you work your way through the class.

    ```py linenums="1"
    # Run an agent
    agent.run("Teach me Griptape!")
    ```

-   ## Text, Video, Whatever

    ---
  
    Some concepts are taught best through text. Others through video. And still others require both.

    We're happy to provide all of it!
